# Boaz


Boaz is a Chess Engine/Game for playing Chess through voice commands.
Users will have the ability to make moves in chess simply through word
of mouth. (i.e. Bishop to E4 || E4 Bishop takes pawn F5). Initial plan
was to name pieces by number such as Rook 1, but aforementioned way makes
sense. The name Boaz comes from the name of the writer of the classic
film Fresh (1994).

Thinking out loud:
Should there be a way to specify when you want to make a move? A specific
command such as "Make Move" then ```E4 Bishop to VALID POSITION```

Plans:

A Mobile App

A Desktop App

A Web App

-- How cool would it be to be able to use software like [Neurable](https://neurable.com) to make moves?
